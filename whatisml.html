        <p>Is a calculator “intelligent”?</p>
        <p>What about a microwave, or a digital watch, or an ATM?</p>
        <p>These technologies all use computers, but we don’t think of them as “smart”.</p>
        <p>After all, without a user, computers were useless. They couldn’t think for themselves.</p>
        <p>Until we discovered machine learning.</p>
        <p>With machine learning algorithms, we can teach computers to "learn" and "reason" based on training data.</p>
        <p>This discovery has some incredible implications.</p>
        <p>But since you and I aren't experts, we'll stick to broad, useful, far-reaching principles.</p>
        <p>First up, some different <a href="./typesofml">types of machine learning</a>.</p>
