        <p>Experience is a valuable teacher.</p>
        <p>Like doctors learning from each case, ML models use each piece of training data to refine their predictions.</p>
        <p>One way of doing this is through parameters.</p>
        <p>Parameters are internal, modifiable variables within a model, used to produce predictions based on inputs. The two most common types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weights — these tweak the relative importance of different input features in the overall prediction</li>
            <li>Biases — these enable the model to alter its predictions independent of weights</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When models us parameters, we call it "parametric machine learning" (such as in linear or logistic regression).</p>
        <p>But other algorithms, like the decision trees we discussed earlier, are "non-parametric". These models don't assume anything about the form of the training data, and therefore don't use parameters to specify anything about their functions.</p>
        <p>In both cases, models can still have "hyper-parameters".</p>
        <p>These have set values before any data is seen, alter how the model interacts with data. Examples include maximum depth of a decision tree, or learning rate in gradient descent.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which: what is <a href="./gradientdescent">gradient descent</a>?</p>
