        <p>We now understand that computer models can learn from training data.</p>
        <p>But that doesn’t answer the question – how?</p>
        <p>We’ll get into some specifics soon, but first, there are few broad types of machine learning to understand:</p>
        <ul class="tight">
            <li>Supervised Learning — Here, data is "labelled", letting the model compare its predictions to correct answers.</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning — Data is unlabelled, meaning the model is left to find its own patterns and draw its own conclusions.</li>
            <li>Self-Supervised Learning — The model labels its own data (thus "supervising" itself).</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning — The model is trained using a system of "reward" and "punishment", much like a silicone dog made of mathematics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Much like in humans, spending too much time memorising arbitrary data has its downsides.</p>
        <p>So, to find the sweet spot between myopic poindexter and unemployable generalist, we need to understand some <a href="./biasandvariance">tradeoffs</a>.</p>
