        <p>In med school, we're taught to keep a broad differential.</p>
        <p>We're told that, while common things happening commonly, we should never allow ourselves to get tunnel vision.</p>
        <p>The exact same principle applies in machine learning. Which leads us to bias-variance tradeoff.</p>
        <p>For instance, imagine an overly simplistic model. This is the med student who skimmed the textbook chapter, but didn't bother with the details.</p>
        <p>Such a model has "high bias", meaning it's too simple to pick up nuances in data, leading to "underfitting".</p>
        <p>But the inverse also applies.</p>
        <p>If a model gets too accustomed to certain data, it may lose its ability to generalise, leading to "high-variance" models and "overfitting". This is the kid who always brings up semi-relevant zebra diagnoses just to remind everyone how smart he is.</p>
        <p>The sweet spot, as you'd expect, lies in the middle.</p>
        <p>And to better understand why this is, we need to understand the role of <a href="./mlalgs">machine learning algorithms</a>.</p>
